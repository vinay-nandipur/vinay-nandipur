    <p><em>My Thoughts on Improving Interview Process(Talent Aquisition):</em></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Talent selection should not be based on memory power(Example: There is many technical exams like <a class="link-color" href="https://www.offensive-security.com/pwk-oscp/">OSCP</a> certification allows users to take tests by referring online).</li>
      <li>It's okay to take a break in between professional career, I don't understand why taking a break in professional career is a problem for some people/organisations.</li>
      <li>It's good if there is a snadbox access given & assign a demo project to work on, so that, capable person can showcase their talent.</li>
      <li>It's always not run against time, what I mean is, asking a person to develop a app/write a automation script in 10 minutes and deciding on that is really not fair.</li>
      <li>In fact, there is no need for a panel or a particular person to take technical interview, complete process can be automated.</li>
      <li>People attending the automated technical interview can enable the webcam & live record themselves while taking automated interviews by explaining what ever the steps they are going through.</li>
      <li>Automated technical interviews are useful just because panel member/s (not all but some of them) try to de-motivate the person attending the interview, which can be avoided easily with automated technical interviews.</li>
    </ul>
